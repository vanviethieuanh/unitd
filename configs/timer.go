// TimerBlock represents the [Timer] section of a systemd unit.
//
// A unit configuration file whose name ends in encodes information about a timer controlled and
// supervised by systemd, for timer-based activation.
//
// This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit type. See for the common options
// of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit]
// and [Install] sections. The timer specific configuration options are configured in the [Timer]
// section.
//
// For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer
// elapses. By default, a service by the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is activated.
// Example: a timer file activates a matching service . The unit to activate may be controlled by (see
// below).
//
// Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the time the timer elapses it is not
// restarted, but simply left running. There is no concept of spawning new service instances in this
// case. Due to this, services with set (which stay around continuously even after the service's main
// process exited) are usually not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they will only be
// activated once, and then stay around forever. Target units, which by default do not deactivate on
// their own, can be activated repeatedly by timers by setting on them. This will cause a target unit
// to be stopped immediately after its activation, if it is not a dependency of another running unit.
type TimerBlock struct {
	// Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled to elapse
	// within a time window starting with the time specified in OnCalendar=, OnActiveSec=, OnBootSec=,
	// OnStartupSec=, OnUnitActiveSec= or OnUnitInactiveSec= and ending the time configured with
	// AccuracySec= later. Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a host-specific,
	// randomized, but stable position that is synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
	// order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set
	// this option to 1us. Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack configured via
	// <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-system.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>'s
	// TimerSlackNSec= setting. See
	// <citerefentry><refentrytitle>prctl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> for
	// details. To optimize power consumption, make sure to set this value as high as possible and as low
	// as necessary.
	//
	// Note that this setting is primarily a power saving option that allows coalescing CPU wake-ups. It
	// should not be confused with RandomizedDelaySec= (see below) which adds a random value to the time
	// the timer shall elapse next and whose purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events
	// over a longer period to reduce workload spikes. For further details and explanations and how both
	// settings play together, see below.
	//
	AccuracySec int `hcl:"accuracy_sec,optional" systemd:"AccuracySec"`
	// Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the timer schedules the next elapse based on the trigger
	// unit entering inactivity, instead of the last trigger time. This is most apparent in the case where
	// the service unit takes longer to run than the timer interval. With this setting enabled, the timer
	// will schedule the next elapse based on when the service finishes running, and so it will have to
	// wait until the next realtime elapse time to trigger. Otherwise, the default behavior is for the
	// timer unit to immediately trigger again once the service finishes running. This happens because the
	// timer schedules the next elapse based on the previous trigger time, and since the interval is
	// shorter than the service runtime, that elapse will be in the past, causing it to immediately trigger
	// once done.
	//
	// This setting has an effect only if a realtime timer has been specified with OnCalendar=. Defaults to
	// false.
	//
	DeferReactivation bool `hcl:"defer_reactivation,optional" systemd:"DeferReactivation"`
	// Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized delay specified by RandomizedDelaySec= is
	// chosen deterministically, and remains stable between all firings of the same timer, even if the
	// manager is restarted. The delay is derived from the machine ID, the manager's user identifier, and
	// the timer unit's name. This effectively creates a unique fixed offset for each timer, reducing the
	// jitter in firings of an individual timer while still avoiding firing at the same time as other
	// similarly configured timers.
	//
	// This setting has an effect only if RandomizedDelaySec= is not 0. Defaults to false.
	//
	FixedRandomDelay bool `hcl:"fixed_random_delay,optional" systemd:"FixedRandomDelay"`
	// Defines a timer relative to the moment the timer unit itself is activated.
	OnActiveSec []string `hcl:"on_active_sec,optional" systemd:"OnActiveSec"`
	// Defines a timer relative to when the machine was booted up. In containers, for the system manager
	// instance, this is mapped to OnStartupSec=, making both equivalent.
	OnBootSec []string `hcl:"on_boot_sec,optional" systemd:"OnBootSec"`
	// Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See
	// <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.time</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry> for
	// more information on the syntax of calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are similar
	// to OnActiveSec= and related settings.
	//
	// Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with this setting, as it
	// is subject to the AccuracySec= setting below.
	//
	// May be specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever any of the
	// specified expressions elapse. Moreover, calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above) may be
	// combined within the same timer unit.
	//
	// If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both
	// OnCalendar= timers and monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will have no effect.
	//
	// Note that calendar timers might be triggered at unexpected times if the system's realtime clock is
	// not set correctly. Specifically, on systems that lack a battery-buffered Realtime Clock (RTC) it
	// might be wise to enable systemd-time-wait-sync.service to ensure the clock is adjusted to a network
	// time source before the timer event is set up. Timer units with at least one OnCalendar= expression
	// are automatically ordered after time-sync.target, which systemd-time-wait-sync.service is ordered
	// before.
	//
	// When a system is temporarily put to sleep (i.e. system suspend or hibernation) the realtime clock
	// does not pause. When a calendar timer elapses while the system is sleeping it will not be acted on
	// immediately, but once the system is later resumed it will catch up and process all timers that
	// triggered while the system was sleeping. Note that if a calendar timer elapsed more than once while
	// the system was continuously sleeping the timer will only result in a single service activation. If
	// WakeSystem= (see below) is enabled a calendar time event elapsing while the system is suspended will
	// cause the system to wake up (under the condition the system's hardware supports time-triggered
	// wake-up functionality).
	//
	OnCalendar []string `hcl:"on_calendar,optional" systemd:"OnCalendar"`
	// These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system
	// clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) jumps relative to the monotonic clock (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), or when the local
	// system timezone is modified. These options can be used alone or in combination with other timer
	// expressions (see above) within the same timer unit. These options default to false.
	OnClockChange bool `hcl:"on_clock_change,optional" systemd:"OnClockChange"`
	// Defines a timer relative to when the service manager was first started. For system timer units this
	// is very similar to OnBootSec= as the system service manager is generally started very early at boot.
	// It's primarily useful when configured in units running in the per-user service manager, as the user
	// service manager is generally started on first login only, not already during boot.
	OnStartupSec []string `hcl:"on_startup_sec,optional" systemd:"OnStartupSec"`
	// These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system
	// clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) jumps relative to the monotonic clock (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), or when the local
	// system timezone is modified. These options can be used alone or in combination with other timer
	// expressions (see above) within the same timer unit. These options default to false.
	OnTimezoneChange bool `hcl:"on_timezone_change,optional" systemd:"OnTimezoneChange"`
	// Defines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last activated.
	OnUnitActiveSec []string `hcl:"on_unit_active_sec,optional" systemd:"OnUnitActiveSec"`
	// Defines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last deactivated.
	OnUnitInactiveSec []string `hcl:"on_unit_inactive_sec,optional" systemd:"OnUnitInactiveSec"`
	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is stored on
	// disk. When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it would have been
	// triggered at least once during the time when the timer was inactive. Such triggering is nonetheless
	// subject to the delay imposed by RandomizedDelaySec=. This is useful to catch up on missed runs of
	// the service when the system was powered down. Note that this setting only has an effect on timers
	// configured with OnCalendar=. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Use systemctl clean --what=state … on the timer unit to remove the timestamp file maintained by
	// this option from disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a timer unit. See
	// <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemctl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> for
	// details.
	//
	Persistent bool `hcl:"persistent,optional" systemd:"Persistent"`
	// Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and the
	// specified time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no randomized delay shall be applied. Each
	// timer unit will determine this delay randomly before each iteration, unless modified with
	// FixedRandomDelay=, see below. The delay is added on top of the next determined elapsing time or the
	// service manager's startup time, whichever is later.
	//
	// This setting is useful to stretch dispatching of similarly configured timer events over a certain
	// time interval, to prevent them from firing all at the same time, possibly resulting in resource
	// congestion on the local system.
	//
	// Note the relation to AccuracySec= above: the latter allows the service manager to coalesce timer
	// events within a specified time range in order to minimize wakeups, while this setting does the
	// opposite: it stretches timer events over an interval, to make it unlikely that they fire
	// simultaneously. If RandomizedDelaySec= and AccuracySec= are used in conjunction, first the
	// randomized delay is added, and then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other
	// timer events happening on the system. As mentioned above AccuracySec= defaults to 1 minute and
	// RandomizedDelaySec= to 0, thus encouraging coalescing of timer events. In order to optimally stretch
	// timer events over a certain range of time, set AccuracySec=1us and RandomizedDelaySec= to some
	// higher value.
	//
	RandomizedDelaySec int `hcl:"randomized_delay_sec,optional" systemd:"RandomizedDelaySec"`
	// Offsets the timer by a stable, randomly-selected, and evenly distributed amount of time between 0
	// and the specified time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no such offset shall be applied. The
	// offset is chosen deterministically, and is derived the same way as FixedRandomDelay=, see above. The
	// offset is added on top of the next determined elapsing time. This setting only has an effect on
	// timers configured with OnCalendar=, and it can be combined with RandomizedDelaySec=.
	//
	// Much like RandomizedDelaySec=, this setting is for distributing timer events to prevent them from
	// firing all at once. However, this setting is most useful to prevent resource congestion on a remote
	// service, from a fleet of similarly-configured clients. Unlike RandomizedDelaySec=, this setting
	// applies its offset with no regard to manager startup time. This maintains the periodicity of
	// configured OnCalendar= events across manager restarts.
	//
	// For example, let's say you're running a backup service and have a fleet of laptops that wish to make
	// backups weekly. To distribute load on the backup service, each laptop should randomly pick a weekday
	// to upload its backups. This could be achieved by setting OnCalendar= to weekly, and then configuring
	// a RandomizedDelaySec= of 5 days with FixedRandomDelay= enabled. Let's say that some laptop randomly
	// chooses a delay of 4 days. If this laptop is restarted more often than that, then the timer will
	// never fire: on each fresh boot, the 4 day delay is restarted and will not be finished by the time of
	// the next shutdown. Instead, you should use RandomizedOffsetSec=, which will maintain the configured
	// weekly cadence of timer events, even across reboots.
	//
	RandomizedOffsetSec int `hcl:"randomized_offset_sec,optional" systemd:"RandomizedOffsetSec"`
	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, a timer will stay loaded, and its state remains queryable even
	// after it elapsed and the associated unit (as configured with Unit=, see above) deactivated again. If
	// false, an elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore is unloaded once its associated unit
	// deactivated again. Turning this off is particularly useful for transient timer units. Note that this
	// setting has an effect when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if RemainAfterElapse= is on, starting
	// the timer a second time has no effect. However, if RemainAfterElapse= is off and the timer unit was
	// already unloaded, it can be started again, and thus the service can be triggered multiple times.
	// Defaults to true.
	RemainAfterElapse bool `hcl:"remain_after_elapse,optional" systemd:"RemainAfterElapse"`
	// The unit to activate when this timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not
	// .timer. If not specified, this value defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer unit,
	// except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended that the unit name that is activated and the
	// unit name of the timer unit are named identically, except for the suffix.
	Unit string `hcl:"unit,optional" systemd:"Unit"`
	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from suspend,
	// should it be suspended and if the system supports this. Note that this option will only make sure
	// the system resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of suspending it again after any
	// work that is to be done is finished. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Note that this functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only available in the system
	// service manager.
	//
	// Note that behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with OnActiveSec=, OnBootSec=,
	// OnStartupSec=, OnUnitActiveSec=, OnUnitInactiveSec=, see above) is altered depending on this option.
	// If false, a monotonic clock is used that is paused during system suspend (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), if true
	// a different monotonic clock is used that continues advancing during system suspend (CLOCK_BOOTTIME),
	// see <citerefentry><refentrytitle>clock_getres</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	// for details.
